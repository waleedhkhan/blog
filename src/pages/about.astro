        hi, i'm waleed. software engineer and entrepreneur based in berlin.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        i grew up in vienna and studied computer science & business, but fell in love with building things on the internet early on. what started as tinkering with online shops turned into a career, and eventually, a calling.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        berlin felt like the right place for someone who wanted to build things differently. less corporate, more experimental. it's been home ever since.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        along the way, i co-founded a company, led engineering teams, and worked with everyone from scrappy startups to large corporations. my background is technical, but these days i think as much about product and people as i do about code.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        i believe in simplicity over complexity, autonomy over control, and substance over hype.
