Accessibility in e-commerce boils down to a simple first principle: if more people can use your website, more people can buy from you. When you remove barriers for those with visual, hearing, or cognitive impairments, you automatically expand your potential customer base.

That translates into higher conversions and stronger brand loyalty. You don’t need sweeping changes to see real impact, either. Something as straightforward as including alternative text for images or ensuring your fonts are easy to read can open the door to more sales. 

The added bonus is that you’ll also be showing customers you care about inclusivity, which helps build trust. In the end, improving accessibility isn’t just about meeting guidelines. It’s about creating a better experience for everyone and boosting revenue at the same time.
