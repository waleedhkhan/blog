## From The Blog

If you missed it, my recent post on [Consultants and the Illusion of Complexity](/posts/consultants-and-the-illusion-of-complexity) argues that we're not in an era of decade-long waterfall projects anymore. With AI, you can prototype in days rather than months.

The explosion of specialized AI tools I've found this week reinforces this point. We're seeing rapid innovation in narrowly-focused applications that excel at specific tasks, making specialized AI capabilities accessible to more people and more use cases.

Next week I'll share some thoughts on how I'm incorporating these tools into my own workflows and what I've learned in the process.

Until then
