Lately, I've been talking to a lot of external business consultants, and it's fascinating how they still overcomplicate everything despite having tech know-how.

It's 2025. We're not in an era of decade-long waterfall projects where every tiny variable needs to be planned out in exhaustive detail. That mindset is exactly why so much innovation has been missed.

We live in the Age of AI, where you can prototype in days if not hours. The speed at which ideas can go from concept to working prototype today gives you infinitely more insight than any â‚¬1,000-per-hour consultant dressing up theoretical ideas in polished slides.

Execution beats speculation. Speed beats theory. And yet, too many still cling to outdated ways of thinking, mistaking complexity for competence.

Real innovation doesn't come from more planning. It comes from building, testing, and iterating.
