Each editor offers its own unique blend of capabilities, plugins, and design. Yet, no matter how many I sample, I always find myself returning to Sublime Text.\n\n\n## Speed and Responsiveness\nSublime Text’s lightweight nature is a breath of fresh air. It launches almost instantly and remains fast even when juggling large files or multiple projects. This seamless performance saves time, letting me focus on coding rather than waiting for the editor to catch up.\n\n## Minimalist Environment\nWhile it’s tempting to have every plugin or feature under the sun, Sublime Text provides a clean, distraction-free workspace. I add only the essentials I truly need, which keeps my workflow organized and my editor clutter-free.\n\n## Power Under the Hood\nDespite its minimalist feel, Sublime Text packs powerful features like multiple cursors, advanced find and replace, and robust syntax highlighting. It strikes a balance between being resource-friendly and offering the right tools to boost productivity.\n\n## Customization and Control\nSublime Text may be lean at first glance, but it’s also highly customizable. From themes to keybindings, it’s easy to tailor the editor to my exact preferences. This flexibility lets me create an environment that optimizes my coding process.\n\n## The Comfort of Familiarity\nEvery editor has its strengths, and I’ll admit that tools like VS Code are incredible for specific workflows. But Sublime Text feels like home—simple, elegant, and always dependable.\n\nMaybe it’s not about finding the newest, shiniest tool. Sometimes, the best editor is the one that quietly gets out of your way and lets you do what you do best: write great code.\n\nWhat’s your go-to editor, and why?

I’ve been a user for at least a decade, and in all that time, I can’t think of a single meaningful feature they’ve added that improves my experience. Instead, it’s been a constant barrage of bizarre changes features that make me wonder if I’m just an outlier or if everyone else is using the platform differently.\n\nTake video podcasts. Who is watching videos on Spotify? Why is a music app even trying to compete in that space? Then there’s the desktop app, which feels like it needs to be restarted every other day just to function properly. The whole thing is frustrating because, at its core, Spotify is still the best streaming service for music discovery and convenience, but they seem determined to bloat it beyond recognition.\n\nThe financials paint an interesting picture. Spotify reported 601 million monthly active users in late 2023, with 226 million of them being paid subscribers. Despite this, the company has struggled with profitability, frequently reporting losses even as it expands into new markets and services. In an attempt to improve margins, they’ve raised subscription prices, cut costs, and laid off thousands of employees including many in their podcast division, the same area they were aggressively expanding just a couple of years ago.","src/content/posts/spotify.mdx","064f130d9a5bd59a","spotify.mdx","accessibility",{"id":40,"data":42,"body":48,"filePath":49,"digest":50,"legacyId":51,"deferredRender":24},{"title":43,"subtitle":44,"tags":45,"publishedAt":47,"isDraft":19},"Accessibility","The low hanging fruit that boosts traffic",[17,40,46,33],"productdev",["Date","2025-02-11T00:00:00.000Z"],"Accessibility in e-commerce boils down to a simple first principle: if more people can use your website, more people can buy from you. When you remove barriers for those with visual, hearing, or cognitive impairments, you automatically expand your potential customer base.\n\nThat translates into higher conversions and stronger brand loyalty. You don’t need sweeping changes to see real impact, either. Something as straightforward as including alternative text for images or ensuring your fonts are easy to read can open the door to more sales. \n\nThe added bonus is that you’ll also be showing customers you care about inclusivity, which helps build trust. In the end, improving accessibility isn’t just about meeting guidelines.

You can throw random words into an LLM and hope it gives you gold, or you can craft prompts intentionally, nudging the model toward the output you actually want. Most people underestimate how much control they have over an LLM’s response until they learn the right techniques.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understanding Prompt Conditioning\n\nLLMs generate output based on probabilities. Every word you add to a prompt shapes the model’s response. Even small tweaks can make a big difference. Consider these variations:\n\n**Example:**\n\n- **\"Tell me about Apple.\"** → Mixed response (company or fruit).\n- **\"Tell me about Apple, the tech company.\"** → Focused on Apple Inc.\n- **\"Tell me about Apple, the fruit.\"** → Focused on apples as a fruit.\n\nThe more specific you are, the better your results.\n\n## 2. Assigning Roles to Improve Accuracy\n\nInstead of asking for a generic answer, provide context for the model’s persona.\n\n### Example: Teaching LLMs to Explain Differently\n\n- **\"Explain how a car engine works.\"** → General explanation.\n- **\"You are a preschool teacher. Explain how a car engine works.\"** → Simple, analogy-based explanation.\n- **\"You are an automotive engineer. Explain how a car engine works.\"** → Technical and in-depth response.\n\n### Example: Content Moderation Task\n\n- **\"Is this image generation prompt safe?\"** → Basic yes/no.\n- **\"Claude, you are an expert content moderator. Identify harmful aspects.\"** → More nuanced response.\n- **\"Claude, you are responsible for filtering harmful prompts. List concerns.\"** → Structured breakdown of concerns.\n\n## 3. Structured Input and Output for Cleaner Responses\n\nUsing structured input helps improve response clarity and consistency.\n\n### Example: Extracting Product Details\n\nInstead of:\n\n```plaintext\nExtract product details from this description.\n```\n\nUse structured instructions:\n\n```xml\nExtract the \u003Cname>, \u003Csize>, \u003Cprice>, and \u003Ccolor> from this product \u003Cdescription>.\n\u003Cdescription>\nThe SmartHome Mini is a compact smart home assistant available in black or white for 49.99€.\n\u003C/description>\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n\n```xml\n\u003Cname>SmartHome Mini\u003C/name>\n\u003Csize>Compact\u003C/size>\n\u003Cprice>49.99€\u003C/price>\n\u003Ccolor>Black or White\u003C/color>\n```\n\nFor JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"SmartHome Mini\",\n  \"size\": \"Compact\",\n  \"price\": \"49.99€\",\n  \"color\": \"Black or White\"\n}\n```\n\n## 4. Prefilling Responses to Guide Output\n\nLLMs can be forced into a particular structure by preloading part of the response.\n\n### Example: Enforcing XML Formatting\n\n```xml\nExtract the \u003Cname>, \u003Csize>, \u003Cprice>, and \u003Ccolor> from this product \u003Cdescription>.\n\n\u003Cdescription>\nThe UltraPhone X is a powerful smartphone available in midnight blue for 999€\n\u003C/description>\n\nReturn the extracted attributes within \u003Cattributes>.\n```\n\nPrefilled Assistant Response:\n\n```xml\n\u003Cattributes>\u003Cname>\n```\n\nEnsures the model follows the structure correctly.\n\n## 5. N-shot Prompting for Better Learning\n\nProviding examples helps LLMs understand tasks better.\n\n### Example: Sentiment Analysis\n\nInstead of:\n\n```plaintext\nAnalyze the sentiment of this review: \"The battery life is amazing, but the screen is too dim.\"\n```\n\nUse multiple examples:\n\n```plaintext\nReview: \"The battery life is great!\"\nSentiment: Positive\n\nReview: \"The screen is too dim.\"\nSentiment: Negative\n\nReview: \"The battery life is amazing, but the screen is too dim.\"\nSentiment:\n```\n\n## 6. Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Complex Reasoning\n\nInstead of asking for an answer outright, tell the model to think step by step.\n\n### Example: Summarizing a Meeting Transcript\n\n```xml\nClaude, you are responsible for summarizing a meeting \u003Ctranscript>.\n\n\u003Ctranscript>\nThe team discussed launching the new product next quarter. They also decided on pricing and marketing strategy.\n\u003C/transcript>\n\nThink step by step about what should be included in a \u003Csummary>.\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n\n```xml\n\u003Csummary>\n- Decision: Launch next quarter\n- Pricing: Set at 499€\n- Marketing: Focus on social media\n\u003C/summary>\n```\n\n## 7. Splitting Large Prompts into Multiple Steps\n\nLarge, complex tasks can be broken down into smaller prompts for better accuracy.\n\n### Example: Multi-Step Information Extraction\n\n- **Step 1:** Extract key topics from the meeting transcript.\n- **Step 2:** Verify that extracted key topics match the transcript.\n- **Step 3:** Rewrite the verified key points into a bullet-point summary.\n\n## 8. Fine-Tuning for Optimal Context Placement\n\nFor Claude, the best format often follows:\n\n- **Role or Responsibility** (e.g., \"You are a financial analyst...\")\n- **Context or Document** (e.g., \"Here is the earnings report...\")\n- **Task Instructions** (e.g., \"Summarize the key financial highlights...\")\n- **Prefilled Response** (if needed)\n\nTesting different structures can yield better results.\n\n## 9. Avoiding Hallucinations with Guardrails\n\nTo minimize incorrect answers, allow the model to say “I don’t know.”\n\n### Example: Ensuring Accuracy\n\n```xml\nAnswer based only on the \u003Ccontext> below.\n\n\u003Ccontext>\nApple Inc. was founded in 1976.\n\u003C/context>\n\nQuestion: When was Apple Inc. founded?\n\nIf the answer is not in the \u003Ccontext>, respond with \"I don’t know.\"\n```\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nPrompt engineering is about clarity, precision, and understanding how LLMs operate. The more specific and structured your prompt, the better your results. Experiment with roles, structure, prefilled responses, and multi-step workflows to get the most reliable outputs.","src/content/posts/effective-prompts.mdx","19364b9ad8287d29","effective-prompts.mdx","consultants-and-the-illusion-of-complexity",{"id":65,"data":67,"body":73,"filePath":74,"digest":75,"rendered":76,"legacyId":86},{"title":68,"subtitle":69,"tags":70,"publishedAt":72,"isDraft":19},"Consultants and the Illusion of Complexity","Why speed beats theory in the Age of AI",[58,71,33],"innovation",["Date","2025-02-24T00:00:00.000Z"],"Lately, I've been talking to a lot of external business consultants, and it's fascinating how they still overcomplicate everything despite having tech know-how.\n\nIt's 2025.

By 2030, millions of jobs will have disappeared, while entirely new industries will emerge. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 makes one thing clear: those who adapt the fastest will thrive. With 170 million new roles on the horizon and 92 million set to vanish, the divide between those who reskill and those who don’t will define the workforce of the future.\n\nAt the center of this transformation is Big Tech, which isn’t just influencing the job market; it’s controlling it. AI, automation, and digital platforms are no longer tools; they are entire ecosystems, consolidating power and redefining work itself. Silicon Valley isn’t just disrupting industries; it’s absorbing them. AI, once a supporting player, is now a full-fledged workforce, eliminating clerical jobs, creative roles, and even decision-making positions. The message is clear: if a job can be automated, it will be. But this isn’t just about job loss; it’s about opportunity. AI, cybersecurity, data science, and software development are the gold rush of the 21st century. AI specialists, big data analysts, and robotics engineers will dominate the next decade. Generative AI is already supercharging workers, turning ordinary professionals into hyper-efficient, tech-powered forces. The real winners? Those who master these tools, not those who fear them.\n\nBeyond tech, demographic shifts are colliding with workforce demands. Aging populations in high-income countries are creating an unprecedented demand for healthcare professionals, personal care aides, and social workers—roles that cannot be automated. Meanwhile, in emerging markets, booming working-age populations are fueling demand for teachers, vocational trainers, and engineers. The challenge? The jobs aren’t keeping up with the workers. Without a radical shift in education and skills training, hundreds of millions could find themselves underemployed or entirely left behind. Governments and businesses need to act fast or risk economic stagnation and workforce instability.\n\nA global economic and geopolitical storm is brewing, reshaping labor markets with trade restrictions, inflation, and shifting industrial policies. Half of all employers cite inflation as a top concern, while economic slowdowns are expected to displace 1.6 million jobs worldwide. The takeaway? The era of job security is over. Workers who can pivot, upskill, and embrace change will thrive; those who cling to outdated roles will struggle. Climate change isn’t just a crisis; it’s a massive economic shift. Green jobs, including renewable energy engineers, environmental specialists, and electric vehicle experts, are in explosive demand. Yet, despite a 12% rise in workers acquiring green skills, demand is still outpacing supply. The opportunity is massive but only for those who move fast.\n\nAs we accelerate toward 2030, the skills that got you here won’t get you there. The report warns that 40% of today’s skills will be obsolete in just five years. Analytical thinking, adaptability, AI proficiency, and digital literacy are no longer optional; they’re the new baseline. Employers know this. Eighty-five percent are prioritizing workforce training, and 50% are already transitioning employees into new roles. Those who fail to adapt risk becoming obsolete.\n\nFor workers, businesses, and policymakers, the choices are stark: embrace change or be left behind. Companies that fail to invest in reskilling will struggle to compete. Workers who refuse to adapt will see their opportunities shrink. Governments that delay action on talent mobility and education reform will watch their economies stagnate. The Future of Jobs Report 2025 makes one thing clear: this is a world for those who are ready to play offense, not defense. The labor market of tomorrow belongs to those who can read the trends, invest in the right skills, and stay ahead of disruption. Big Tech isn’t waiting. AI isn’t slowing down. The future is being built now. Are you ready?\n\n## Credits\n\n- World Economic Forum – Future of Jobs Report 2025\n- Data and insights sourced from employer surveys covering 14 million workers across 55 economies\n- Contributions from ADP, Coursera, Indeed, and LinkedIn for labor market research\n- Research and analysis by the Centre for the New Economy and Society at the World Economic Forum","src/content/posts/future-of-jobs.mdx","e78195c8a346e265","future-of-jobs.mdx"]
