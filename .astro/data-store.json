Each editor offers its own unique blend of capabilities, plugins, and design. Yet, no matter how many I sample, I always find myself returning to Sublime Text.\n\n\n## Speed and Responsiveness\nSublime Text’s lightweight nature is a breath of fresh air. It launches almost instantly and remains fast even when juggling large files or multiple projects. This seamless performance saves time, letting me focus on coding rather than waiting for the editor to catch up.\n\n## Minimalist Environment\nWhile it’s tempting to have every plugin or feature under the sun, Sublime Text provides a clean, distraction-free workspace. I add only the essentials I truly need, which keeps my workflow organized and my editor clutter-free.\n\n## Power Under the Hood\nDespite its minimalist feel, Sublime Text packs powerful features like multiple cursors, advanced find and replace, and robust syntax highlighting. It strikes a balance between being resource-friendly and offering the right tools to boost productivity.\n\n## Customization and Control\nSublime Text may be lean at first glance, but it’s also highly customizable. From themes to keybindings, it’s easy to tailor the editor to my exact preferences. This flexibility lets me create an environment that optimizes my coding process.\n\n## The Comfort of Familiarity\nEvery editor has its strengths, and I’ll admit that tools like VS Code are incredible for specific workflows. But Sublime Text feels like home—simple, elegant, and always dependable.\n\nMaybe it’s not about finding the newest, shiniest tool. Sometimes, the best editor is the one that quietly gets out of your way and lets you do what you do best: write great code.\n\nWhat’s your go-to editor, and why?

I’ve been a user for at least a decade, and in all that time, I can’t think of a single meaningful feature they’ve added that improves my experience. Instead, it’s been a constant barrage of bizarre changes features that make me wonder if I’m just an outlier or if everyone else is using the platform differently.\n\nTake video podcasts. Who is watching videos on Spotify? Why is a music app even trying to compete in that space? Then there’s the desktop app, which feels like it needs to be restarted every other day just to function properly. The whole thing is frustrating because, at its core, Spotify is still the best streaming service for music discovery and convenience, but they seem determined to bloat it beyond recognition.\n\nThe financials paint an interesting picture. Spotify reported 601 million monthly active users in late 2023, with 226 million of them being paid subscribers. Despite this, the company has struggled with profitability, frequently reporting losses even as it expands into new markets and services. In an attempt to improve margins, they’ve raised subscription prices, cut costs, and laid off thousands of employees including many in their podcast division, the same area they were aggressively expanding just a couple of years ago.","src/content/posts/spotify.mdx","064f130d9a5bd59a","spotify.mdx","accessibility",{"id":40,"data":42,"body":48,"filePath":49,"digest":50,"legacyId":51,"deferredRender":24},{"title":43,"subtitle":44,"tags":45,"publishedAt":47,"isDraft":19},"Accessibility","The low hanging fruit that boosts traffic",[17,40,46,33],"productdev",["Date","2025-02-11T00:00:00.000Z"],"Accessibility in e-commerce boils down to a simple first principle: if more people can use your website, more people can buy from you. When you remove barriers for those with visual, hearing, or cognitive impairments, you automatically expand your potential customer base.\n\nThat translates into higher conversions and stronger brand loyalty. You don’t need sweeping changes to see real impact, either. Something as straightforward as including alternative text for images or ensuring your fonts are easy to read can open the door to more sales. \n\nThe added bonus is that you’ll also be showing customers you care about inclusivity, which helps build trust. In the end, improving accessibility isn’t just about meeting guidelines. It’s about creating a better experience for everyone and boosting revenue at the same time.","src/content/posts/accessibility.mdx","cc2b12853108225b","accessibility.mdx"]
